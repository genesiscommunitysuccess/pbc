Two pipelines have been constructed to demonstrate these use cases. The first pipeline is sourced by an event handler and uses the data from the event to publish to a kafka topic. The second pipeline then reads from this kafka topic and inserts it into the database. We have split these pipelines into 2 different scripts so that they can be run by 2 separate processes.",
